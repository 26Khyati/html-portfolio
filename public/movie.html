<h1>MY BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME(ACC TO ME)</h1>
<h2>TOP 3</h2>
<hr />
<p><h3>FLIPPED</h3>
This is just so amazing, it is a romcom but not a romcom it makes me happy and teaches about so many subtle aspects of life that we tend to ignore.
The way things are described is amazing obviously book adaptations are gonna have vivid descriptions but yeah</p>
<p><h3>YJHD</h3>
It's just something i could relate to never happened with me tho but yeah</p>
<p><h3>DIL DHADAKNE DO</h3>
i'm in love with this movie, it sends you into a thinking spiral about our society and the relationships that we have.</p>
